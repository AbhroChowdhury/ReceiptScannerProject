# ReceiptScannerProject
This project is based on a smaller project I worked on in my opencv repository. In this repository, my friend Ryan and I are building off of a Asprise OCR API driven python script that analyzes a photo of a receipt, and then provides valuable information regarding the merchant, subtotal, item price, etc.
